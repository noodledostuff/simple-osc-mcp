# OSC MCP Server Workflow Examples

This directory contains practical workflow examples for common use cases of the OSC MCP Server.

## Available Workflows

### [Basic Workflow](basic-workflow.md)
A simple introduction to using the OSC MCP Server with a single endpoint. Perfect for getting started and understanding the core concepts.

**Use Cases:**
- Learning the basic tools and their parameters
- Simple OSC message monitoring
- Single-source OSC communication
- Development and testing

### [Multi-Endpoint Workflow](multi-endpoint-workflow.md)
Demonstrates managing multiple OSC endpoints simultaneously for different types of messages or sources.

**Use Cases:**
- Complex music applications with multiple OSC sources
- Separating different types of messages (MIDI, synth, transport)
- Organizing messages by source or destination
- Scalable OSC message handling

### [Real-time Monitoring Workflow](realtime-monitoring-workflow.md)
Shows how to continuously monitor OSC message flow for live applications and performance scenarios.

**Use Cases:**
- Live music performance monitoring
- Real-time audio parameter tracking
- Interactive installations
- Debugging OSC communication issues

### [Advanced Filtering Workflow](advanced-filtering-workflow.md)
Explores sophisticated message filtering and routing techniques for complex applications.

**Use Cases:**
- Complex message routing logic
- Performance optimization with selective filtering
- Multi-client message distribution
- Advanced pattern matching

## Choosing the Right Workflow

### For Beginners
Start with the **Basic Workflow** to understand:
- How to create and manage OSC endpoints
- Basic message querying and filtering
- Proper resource cleanup

### For Multi-Source Applications
Use the **Multi-Endpoint Workflow** when you need to:
- Handle messages from multiple OSC sources
- Separate different types of messages
- Scale to handle higher message volumes
- Organize complex OSC communication

### For Live Applications
The **Real-time Monitoring Workflow** is ideal for:
- Live performance scenarios
- Interactive installations
- Real-time parameter monitoring
- Continuous message processing

### For Complex Systems
The **Advanced Filtering Workflow** helps with:
- Sophisticated message routing
- Performance optimization
- Complex pattern matching
- Multi-client architectures

## Common Patterns

### Endpoint Management
All workflows demonstrate these key patterns:
- Creating endpoints with appropriate configurations
- Monitoring endpoint status and health
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Error handling and recovery

### Message Handling
Common message handling patterns include:
- Time-based message querying
- Address pattern filtering
- Buffer size management
- Performance optimization

### Integration Patterns
Examples show integration with:
- SuperCollider for audio programming
- Max/MSP for interactive media
- Python scripts for automation
- VSCode for development workflows

## Best Practices

### Resource Management
- Always stop endpoints when finished
- Use appropriate buffer sizes for your use case
- Monitor endpoint status regularly
- Handle port conflicts gracefully

### Performance
- Use address filters to reduce processing overhead
- Query messages with appropriate time windows
- Limit result sets to reasonable sizes
- Consider multiple endpoints for high-traffic scenarios

### Error Handling
- Check endpoint status before sending messages
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Validate message formats and parameters
- Implement retry logic for critical operations

### Development
- Start with simple workflows and build complexity gradually
- Test with known OSC senders before integrating
- Use the provided OSC sender examples for testing
- Monitor logs and error messages for debugging

## Testing Your Workflows

Each workflow can be tested using the OSC sender examples in the `../osc-senders/` directory:

1. **SuperCollider**: Use `supercollider-test.scd` for comprehensive testing
2. **Python**: Run `python-test.py` for automated test sequences
3. **Max/MSP**: Load `max-msp-test.maxpat` for interactive testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Port conflicts**: Use different ports or check what's using the port
- **No messages received**: Verify sender configuration and firewall settings
- **Buffer overflow**: Increase buffer size or query messages more frequently
- **Performance issues**: Use address filters and appropriate buffer sizes

### Debug Strategies
- Start with the basic workflow to verify setup
- Use simple test messages before complex scenarios
- Check endpoint status regularly
- Monitor message counts to verify activity

### Getting Help
- Check the main [README troubleshooting section](../../README.md#troubleshooting)
- Review the specific workflow documentation
- Test with the provided OSC sender examples
- Create GitHub issues for persistent problems

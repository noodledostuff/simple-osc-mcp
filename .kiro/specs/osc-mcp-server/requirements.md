# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to set up OSC (Open Sound Control) endpoints and receive OSC messages. The server will provide tools for establishing OSC communication channels, listening for incoming messages, and managing OSC data flow. This will primarily serve as a development tool for building other OSC-related applications by allowing AI agents to interact with OSC-enabled devices and software.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to create an OSC endpoint, so that I can receive OSC messages from external devices or applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent calls the create OSC endpoint tool THEN the system SHALL establish a UDP socket listening on the specified port
2. WHEN creating an endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate that the port is available and within valid range (1024-65535)
3. IF the port is already in use THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the conflict
4. WHEN an endpoint is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the endpoint details including IP address and port

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to receive and parse OSC messages, so that I can process data from OSC-enabled devices and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OSC message is received on an active endpoint THEN the system SHALL parse the message according to OSC 1.0 specification
2. WHEN parsing a message THEN the system SHALL extract the OSC address pattern, type tags, and arguments
3. WHEN a message is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL make the message data available to the agent
4. IF a malformed OSC message is received THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue listening

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to query received OSC messages, so that I can retrieve and analyze OSC data for application development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent requests recent messages THEN the system SHALL return messages received within a specified time window
2. WHEN querying messages THEN the system SHALL support filtering by OSC address pattern
3. WHEN querying messages THEN the system SHALL support limiting the number of results returned
4. WHEN no messages match the query criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to manage OSC endpoint lifecycle, so that I can start and stop OSC communication as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent calls the stop endpoint tool THEN the system SHALL close the UDP socket and stop listening
2. WHEN stopping an endpoint THEN the system SHALL clean up any associated resources
3. WHEN the agent requests endpoint status THEN the system SHALL return whether the endpoint is active or inactive
4. WHEN the MCP server shuts down THEN the system SHALL automatically close all active OSC endpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to configure OSC message handling, so that I can customize how messages are processed and stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an endpoint THEN the system SHALL allow specifying a message buffer size limit
2. WHEN the message buffer reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL remove oldest messages to make room for new ones
3. WHEN configuring an endpoint THEN the system SHALL allow setting message filtering rules by address pattern
4. IF invalid configuration parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OSC MCP server to be easily accessible via npx, so that I can quickly install and use it without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is published to npm THEN users SHALL be able to run it via `npx osc-mcp-server`
2. WHEN code changes are pushed to the main branch THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL automatically run tests and type checking
3. WHEN a version tag is created THEN the system SHALL automatically publish the package to npm registry
4. WHEN publishing THEN the package SHALL include only necessary files (dist/, README.md, LICENSE)
5. WHEN installing THEN the system SHALL require Node.js version 18 or higher
